                    <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>½ cup whole milk, room temperature</li>
                    <li>½ cup strawberry or raspberry preserves</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

           <li>For the whipped cream
                <ul>
                    <li>¾ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                </ul>
           </li>
           
           <li>To garnish
                <ul>
                    <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar, plus more for dusting</li>
                    <li>fresh strawberrie (Optional)</li>
                </ul>
           </li>
        </ul>

        <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans with baking spray; line bottoms with parchment paper. Lightly spray parchment paper with baking spray.</li>
            <li>Sift flour, cornstarch, and baking powder into a medium bowl; whisk in salt and set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. (The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color.)</li>
            <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, on medium speed, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next, 1 to 2 minutes total. Beat in 2 teaspoons vanilla. With mixer on medium-low speed, add flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk, beating until just combined after each addition.</li>
            <li>Evenly divide batter between prepared pans and spread into an even layer using a small offset spatula. Firmly tap pans on a kitchen towel-lined counter several times to help get rid of any large bubbles in the batter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 18 to 22 minutes. Cool cakes in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn the cakes out onto a wire rack. Let stand, parchment side down, on wire racks until cooled completely, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove and discard parchment paper. Place 1 cake layer on a serving plate. Stir preserves in a small bowl until mostly smooth; spread in an even layer over cake.</li>
            <li>To make vanilla whipped cream: Whisk heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract by hand in a large bowl until stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Dollop over jam, then spread into an even layer.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining cake layer. Dust with powdered sugar and garnish with strawberries (if using).</li>
        </ol>
